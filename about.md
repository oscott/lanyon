In the year 024, I am using paper *Index Cards* to make sense of all these computers full of files. This has really helped clarify what has been going on for many years. However, publishing must continue, so the cards are being converted back into data. This is all hand coded by [Oliver](https://os.koe.pt).

There are currently three bits to this:

* [Catalogue](http://koe.pt) - the old list of projects and colaborations.
* [CV](http://os.koe.pt) - selected list of my work.
* [Notes](http://oscott.github.io/lanyon) - this collection of notes about unravelling this process.
